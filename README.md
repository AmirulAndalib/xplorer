## What is Xplorer?
![Demo](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1SBuUc0BhC49druJwndW2mabS9amTospZ)
Xplorer is a modern file explorer built from ground-up to be fully customizable and even without customization, it also looks modern! It is cross-platform, built using Electron Technology that allowed our File Explorer to be run not only in Windows, but also Linux and MacOS alike, lthough we haven't tested it in macOS yet (macOS maintainer in need). It also allowed file preview directly inside it, not only pictures or documents, but also videos!

So to summary, Xplorer's features contain:
- Looks modern
- Fully customizable
- Easy to use
- Cross-platform
- File Preview, even videos!
- Most importantly, FOSS, Free and Open Source, which mean you can change components inside if you see fit

Xplorer is currently on development progress. Suggest improvement on Xplorer [Discussion](https://github.com/kimlimjustin/xplorer/discussions/) or [contribute into it](https://xplorer.vercel.app/community/Contributing/)!
