# Xplorer

Welcome to xplorer! A Free and Open Source (FOSS) File Explorer.

Xplorer is a file explorer built from ground-up to be fully customizeable and without customization, it also looks modern! 
It is cross-platform, built using Electron Technology that allowed our File Explorer to be run not only in Windows, but also Linux and MacOS alike, although we haven't tested it in macOS yet (macOS maintainer in need). 
It also allowed file preview directly inside it, not only pictures or documents, but also videos!

So to summary, Xplorer's features contain:
- Looks modern
- Full customizeable
- Cross-platform
- File Preview, even videos!
- Most importantly, FOSS, Free and Open Source, which mean you can change components inside if you see fit.
