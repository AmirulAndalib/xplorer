# Xplorer

## Summary

Welcome to xplorer! A Free and Open Source (FOSS) File Explorer.

Xplorer is a file explorer built from ground-up to be fully customizable and without customization, it also looks modern! 
It is cross-platform, built using Electron Technology that allowed our File Explorer to be run not only in Windows, but also Linux and MacOS alike, although we haven't tested it in macOS yet (macOS maintainer in need). 
It also allowed file preview directly inside it, not only pictures or documents, but also videos!

## Features

So to summary, Xplorer's features contain:
- Looks modern
- Fully customizable
- Easy to use
- Cross-platform
- File Preview, even videos!
- Most importantly, it's Free and Open Source! Which mean you can change components inside if you see fit and you also don't make your wallet go dry
