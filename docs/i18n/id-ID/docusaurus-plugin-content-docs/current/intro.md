# Xplorer

## Ringkasan

Welcome to Xplorer, A Free and Open Source (FOSS) File Explorer.

Xplorer is a file explorer built from the ground up to be fully customizable and without customization, it also looks modern! It is cross-platform, built using Electron Technology that allowed our File Explorer to be run not only in Windows but also Linux and MacOS alike. It also allowed file preview directly inside it, not only pictures or documents but also videos!

## Fitur

So to summarize, Xplorer's features contain:

-   Terlihat modern
-   Mudah digunakan
-   Lintas-perangkat
-   Melihat (_preview_) file secara _native_ langsung didalam aplikasi!
-   Yang terpenting, Gratis dan Open Source! Which mean you can change components inside if you see fit and you also don't need to make your wallet go dry or break the bank.
