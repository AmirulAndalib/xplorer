# Install Xplorer in Windows

If you love using Windows, just download and install your installation (.exe) file because who cares to use Windows' CMD other than to check your internet connection.

## Installer link

You can access early dev build [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b63Z258hk7FEJ_Qj5zIv4T6yHKkegfuG/view?usp=sharing).

## Faced Windows Defender?
This is actually not an error, it's a design choice by Microsoft to protect those of us who are not tech-savvy (i.e. potentially your friends) from virus. You don't need to worry the safety of Xplorer in this case, since it's [open source](https://github.com/kimlimjustin/xplorer) and you can inspect the code or even build your own version!

To Handle this, you can just click the `More Info` button, then, just click Run Anyway.
