## File Preview

The file preview here means the preview that replaces the default icon of a file.

### Play video file as a preview

This will automatically play the video file as a preview. :::caution THIS MIGHT CONSUME HIGH AMOUNT OF RAM This might consume a high amount of RAM because it's built on the HTML video player. You can just enable this setting and ignore this caution if you got a good-spec computer. :::

### Extract `EXE` file icon and make it a preview

This will parse and cache the icon from a `exe` file and make it a preview. Only on Windows.

![Extract Exe file icon](/img/docs/extract-exe-icon.png)

:::warning This might causes Xplorer to crash.

This is because Xplorer parses the icon from the exe and if the hexadecimal of the exe file is broken, Xplorer crashes.

The way to fix it is to disable the setting.
